- Prefer guard style over nested conditionals

## Git

- When writing commit messages, try to include as much context around _why_ this change was made.
- Use the imperative mood in commit message titles.
- Always include a "## Test plan" section in commit messages. It's OK to say that the test plan is "YOLO" if there isn't a clear test plan for the commit.
