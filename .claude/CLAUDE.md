- Prefer guard style over nested conditionals

## Comments

- Use `// --` as a section divider when nessecary
- Don't write comments explaining what the code does, only include comments saying _why_ the code is there.

## Git

- When writing commit messages, try to include as much context around _why_ this change was made.
- Use the imperative mood in commit message titles.
- Always include a "## Test plan" section in commit messages. It's OK to say that the test plan is "YOLO" if there isn't a clear test plan for the commit.
